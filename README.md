##  Class of CS 5002 Discrete Structures - Topic of Probability!
## Final Project "Deck of Flashcards"!

### Final Project Description:
#### We developed an interactive study tool inspired by Quizlet, designed to help learners master probability in discrete mathematics through engaging flashcards. The platform supports asynchronous learning with features like test mode, match-based games, and hint support for guided study. Additional highlights include audio playback, progress tracking, memory scores, and favorite flashcards for personalized learning. Users can share decks, rate the platform, and continuously improve their understanding through gamified, self-paced study.
